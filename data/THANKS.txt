Many secrets for scripting.


[h1]Mods that I borrowed[/h1]

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596594446]Helvetica Neue Font[/url]
A classic and neutral font.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484196510]Stylized icons[/url]
Very good style. But I had to replace half of the icons. I also redesigned colors. And some subtle details were improved, too.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=208679449]Clearer Needs Icons[/url]
I replaced and added a few of the icons.

Due to limitations, the fastest speed is 10 times.
Moreover, I used unicode characters to replace the ugly ones.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=461879768]Additional Doors[/url]
I made my own three-meter jail door.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436622291]A lot of new names! Only Names.[/url]

Because the regular prisoners (not form Names in the Game) have the same fornames and surnames over and over again.

Now, more variety. Names comes from all countries while English names are still the majority.

The author "Sci. Leugim678 TCNMS OFU78" kindly asked me to integrate this mod.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448807272]A lot of new skins! Only Normal skins.[/url]

Improves and adds prisoner skin colors. Especially, pink, yellow and black are better than vanilla.

Another mod by "Sci. Leugim678 TCNMS OFU78".


[h1]Mods that I decided not to integrate[/h1]

Don't misunderstand me. They are good.
But I just don't think it is necessary to integrate them.
You can try them independently.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=516250875]Table Bench & Ironboard smaler than the original[/url]
If you like a tiny prison, this can save spaces for you.
Not very realistic. Not very necessary. Can break existing maps (prisons).

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521488103]Disable Sheet Metal[/url]
Still not perfect.
I suggest you invest on Bookkeeping if you don't like Workshop product lines.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=762749999]Read Mails[/url]
Quite creative and very interesting. But only for a short time until you have read all the contents...

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693956799]Real-time Basketball[/url]
Very creative and fun.
The author "murgh" has made many great mods. Don't forget to take a look and try.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687910616]Customizable Control Booths[/url]
Very creative, but very complicated too.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434985481]Simple Garden Mod[/url]
Lovely and quite realistic.

After a lot of thoughts, however, I decided to make Bookkeeping to solve serveral real problems instead of integrating this mod.
